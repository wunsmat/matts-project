Detect copy-pasted and structurally similar code. The inspector identifies
duplicate code, even if modified, as well as common boilerplate or logic that
should be the target of refactoring.

## Overview

We've all had to deal with code smell, and duplicate code is a common source.
While some instances are easy to spot, this type of searching is the perfect
use-case for a helpful CLI tool.

Existing solutions do exist for this purpose, but are often token-based and
rely on string searching methods such as the Rabinâ€“Karp algorithm. Why isn't
this always ideal? Those tools may struggle with code that has wildly varying
identifiers, despite having the same structure and behavior.

And copy-pasted code is but one type of code duplication. Common boilerplate
and repeated logic can be identified as well using jsinspect, since it
doesn't work on tokens - it uses the ASTs of the parsed code.

You have the freedom to specify a threshold determining the smallest subset of
nodes to analyze. This will identify code with a similar structure, based
on the AST node types, e.g. BlockStatement, VariableDeclaration,
ObjectExpression, etc. For copy-paste oriented detection, you can even limit
the search to nodes with matching identifiers.

The tool accepts a list of paths to parse, and outputs any matches along
with a series of 2-way diffs. Any directories among the paths are walked
recursively, and only `.js` files are analyzed. Any `node_modules` and
`bower_components` dirs are also ignored. Being built for JavaScript, it also
ignores ES6 module declarations, CommonJS require statements, and AMD define
expressions.

## Installation

It can be installed via `npm` using:

``` bash
npm install -g jsinspect
```

Also available: [grunt-jsinspect](https://github.com/stefanjudis/grunt-jsinspect),
and [gulp-jsinspect](https://github.com/alexeyraspopov/gulp-jsinspect)

## Usage

```
Usage: jsinspect [options] <paths ...>

Duplicate code and structure detection for JavaScript.
Identifier matching is disabled by default. Example use:
jsinspect -t 30 -i --ignore "Test.js" ./path/to/src


Options:

  -h, --help                         output usage information
  -V, --version                      output the version number
  -t, --threshold <number>           number of nodes (default: 15)
  -i, --identifiers                  match identifiers
  -j, --jsx                          process jsx files (default: false)
  -c, --config                       path to config file (default: .jsinspectrc)
  -r, --reporter [default|json|pmd]  specify the reporter to use
  -s, --suppress <number>            length to suppress diffs (default: 100, off: 0)
  -D, --no-diff                      disable 2-way diffs
  -C, --no-color                     disable colors
  --ignore <pattern>                 ignore paths matching a regex
```

If a `.jsinspectrc` file is located in the project directory, its values will
be used in place of the defaults listed above. For example:

``` javascript
{
  "threshold":     30,
  "identifiers":   true,
  "ignore":        "Test.js|Spec.js", // used as RegExp,
  "jsx":           true,
  "reporter":      "json",
  "suppress":      100
}
```

On first use with a project, you may want to run the tool with the following
options, while running explicitly on the lib/src directories, and not the
test/spec dir.

```
jsinspect -t 30 -i ./path/to/src
```

From there, feel free to try incrementally decreasing the threshold and
ignoring identifiers. A threshold of 20 may lead you to discover new areas of
interest for refactoring or cleanup. Each project or library may be different.

## Integration

It's simple to run jsinspect on your library source as part of a build
process. It will exit with an error code of 0 when no matches are found,
resulting in a passing step, and a positive error code corresponding to its
failure. For example, with Travis CI, you could add the following entries
to your `.travis.yml`:

``` yaml
before_script:
  - "npm install -g jsinspect"

script:
  - "jsinspect -t 30 ./path/to/src"
```

Note that in the above example, we're using a threshold of 30 for detecting
structurally similar code. A lower threshold may work for your build process,
but ~30 should help detect unnecessary boilerplate, while avoiding excessive
output.

To have jsinspect run with each job, but not block or fail the build, you can
use something like the following:

``` yaml
script:
  - "jsinspect -t 30 ./path/to/src || true"
```

## Reporters

Aside from the default reporter, both JSON and PMD CPD-style XML reporters are
available. Note that in the JSON example below, indentation and formatting
has been applied.

#### JSON

``` json
[{
  "instances":[
    {"path":"spec/fixtures/intersection.js","lines":[1,5]},
    {"path":"spec/fixtures/intersection.js","lines":[7,11]}
  ],
  "diffs":[
    {
      "-":{"path":"spec/fixtures/intersection.js","lines":[1,5]},
      "+":{"path":"spec/fixtures/intersection.js","lines":[7,11]},
      "diff":"-  function intersectionA(array1, array2) {\n-    array1.filter(function(n) {\n-      return array2.indexOf(n) != -1;\n+  function intersectionB(arrayA, arrayB) {\n+    arrayA.filter(function(n) {\n+      return arrayB.indexOf(n) != -1;\n     });\n   }\n"
    }
  ]
}]
```

#### PMD CPD XML

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<pmd-cpd>
<duplication lines="10">
<file path="/jsinspect/spec/fixtures/intersection.js" line="1"/>
<file path="/jsinspect/spec/fixtures/intersection.js" line="7"/>
<codefragment>
- spec/fixtures/intersection.js:1,5
+ spec/fixtures/intersection.js:7,11

-  function intersectionA(array1, array2) {
-    array1.filter(function(n) {
-      return array2.indexOf(n) != -1;
+  function intersectionB(arrayA, arrayB) {
+    arrayA.filter(function(n) {
+      return arrayB.indexOf(n) != -1;
     });
   }
</codefragment>
</duplication>
</pmd-cpd>
```

## Performance

Running on a medium sized code base, with a 2.4Ghz i5 MPB, yielded the
following results:

``` bash
$ find src/ -name '*.js' | xargs wc -l
# ...
44810 total

$ time jsinspect -t 30 src/
# Looking for structural similarities..
41 matches found across 800 files

real  0m1.542s
user  0m1.472s
sys   0m0.071s

$ time jsinspect -i -t 15 src/
# Looking for copy-pasted code..
96 matches found across 800 files

real  0m1.283s
user  0m1.196s
sys   0m0.084s
```

Much of the overhead comes from diff generation, so a greater number of matches
will increase running time.
